# Weather-Prediction-Model
# Overview
This repository contains the necessary files, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets for a weather prediction model. The project is designed for live walkthroughs on Dataquest.

These walkthroughs aim to guide you through the entire process of building an end-to-end weather prediction model, providing a valuable addition to your portfolio.

# Prerequisites
To successfully engage with and complete this project, it is recommended that you have a solid understanding of the following:

Python syntax, including functions, if statements, and data structures
Data cleaning techniques
Pandas syntax
Usage of Jupyter notebooks
Basics of machine learning
Ensure that you have completed the relevant Dataquest courses (or equivalent) before attempting these projects:

Python Introduction
For Loops and If Statements
Dictionaries In Python
Functions and Jupyter Notebook
Python Intermediate
Pandas and NumPy Fundamentals
Data Cleaning
Machine Learning Fundamentals

# Datasets
This repository includes eight datasets that are integral to the weather prediction model:

Dataset 1: pune
Dataset 2: bombay
Dataset 3: delhi
Dataset 4: kanpur
Dataset 5: bengaluru
Dataset 6: nagpur
Dataset 7: hyderabad
Dataset 8: jaipur
Please refer to the individual dataset files for specific details on each dataset.

Source Code
The source code for the weather prediction model is available in the Jupyter notebook titled source code.ipynb. You can follow the step-by-step execution in the notebook to understand the implementation of the model.

# Step-by-Step Execution

Open the Jupyter notebook source code.ipynb.
Execute each cell in sequential order.
Read the comments and markdown cells for explanations and instructions.
Provide input according to the city you want the predictions.
Analyze the results and visualize the model's performance.
Feel free to experiment with parameters or extend the model based on your understanding.
For any questions or issues, please open an issue on this repository.

Happy coding!
